#summary SPARQL-DL concrete syntax for writing DL queries.

= Introduction =

SPARQLAS is our implementation of the SPARQL-DL abstract syntax for writing description Logic queries. With SPARQLAS, users write queries faster than using SPARQL, since they do not have to care about mapping OWL to RDF graphs.

= Details =

SPARQLAS queries are automatically translated into SPARQL queries that can be executed using a query engine and reasoner with support to OWL entailment regime, like [http://clarkparsia.com/pellet/ pellet].

SPARQLAS is part of the [InstallationTwoUse TwoUse Toolkit installation].
