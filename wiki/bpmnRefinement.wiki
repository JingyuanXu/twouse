#summary The general idea of BPMN process refinement using Ontologies

= BPMN Process Refinement =

An abstract BPMN process is refined into a more specific process which
is a more fine-grained representation of the process.
There are different kinds of refinement like horizontal or vertical refinements.
A specific process model is a valid refinement of the abstract model
if no refinement condition is violated.

The refinement is validated using ontologies and DL reasoning.
The abstract and specific process is transformed to an OWL DL ontology
which is called the refinement ontology.
Reasoning service indicates whether the specific process
is an valid or invalid refinement of the abstract process.
